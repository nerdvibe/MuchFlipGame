Much Flip Coin is a very hard game built with SnarkyJS. You'll have to guess what your computer thinks and you'll have to defeat it 🧙‍♀️

## Motivation
SnarkzJS from Mina Protocol is here. The first version is out and ready to be explored. With this repository I wanted to create an engaging and fun experience to geting started with SnarkyJS. The logic of the game is very simple. The game is divided in rounds, at the beginning of each round the code picks a "Heads" or "Tails", you as the player, you'll have to guess what the the code picked.



## Getting started:
Much Flip Game is an interactive game. You can start the game by following these commands:
```
npm install
npm start
```
